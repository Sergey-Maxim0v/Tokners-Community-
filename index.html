                        their own digital currency by simply creating a profile with media content posted as Non
                        fungible Tokens that can be owned and traded on the Tknrs network</p>

                <p>Creators can gain independence through a decentralised digital currency system that is
                    dependent on growing and engaging with the community and also their star power. They own
                    10-15% of the total value of the tokens minted.</p>

                <p>Holding social tokens allows the individual to gain access to benefits including unreleased
                    content, private communities, direct access to celebrity, early- access to tickets and more as well
                    as the ability to trade with other communities in order to gain access to more creator content with
                    early token buyers being the biggest winners as the value of the token increases with more buyers.

                    fan driven digital economy where their digital content can be traded as NFTs and their most loyal
                    fans can have the monetary value of their creator's currency increase significantly as they promote
                    their digital currency across their channels while our native token holders benefit from the Weentar

                    <h3>Tokner is coming</h3>
                    <p class="comingBtext">Cryptocurrency adoption is at less than 1% of the global world population
                        with some countries and entities actively fighting against its mass adoption and the smartest
                        developers and nerds holding the fort.</p>
                    <p class="comingtext">Bitcoin was the first, and it has since grown to thousands of tokens launched
                        all aiming to fix one problem or the other with some quite simply FOMOing the moment. Our goal
                        is to bring mass adoption to the cryptocurrency space by dumbing it down. How far down? So down
                        that even a celebrity can explain it in simple words to their followers and have them download
                        an app, buy into the social currency of their favourite person and watch their investment as is
                        with other crypto currency project.</p>
                    <p class="comingtext">We are trying to do to this space what investment apps did for the
                        "nonexistent retail investors". We are gamefying digital currency, bringing in popular faces
                        instead of hard to understand projects to make it the norm and inadvertently being the "gateway
                        drug" for a lot of people to finally give this space a real look.</p>
                    <p class="comingBtext">A new digital economy is coming. People would be just as powerful as
                        countries and creators would be paid beyond the peanuts that conventional social media platforms
                        can offer.</p>
                    <p class="comingtext">There would be new markets and advertisers with little to offer would not find
                        home there. Like Kanye said,</p>
                    <p class="comingCrowntext">"Personalities would become the new currency, and services would be built
                        on top of them".</p>
                    <p class="comingtext">Well, Kanye didn't exactly say that, but it sounds like something we hope he
                        would say.</p>
                    <p class="comingtext">Currency is digital, it has been that way for a while now, but this time there
                        would be no dead presidents on the money, there would people like you on the money, and you
                        would own it because it would make the most sense in the world.</p>
